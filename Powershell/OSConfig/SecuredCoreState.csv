"BootDMAProtection";"Kernel Direct Memory Access (DMA) Protection is a Windows security feature that protects against external peripherals from gaining unauthorized access to memory.";"Integer";"2";"@{Status=NotCompliant; Reason=2 is not equal to 1; Severity=Critical}"
"HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrityStatus";"Memory integrity, also known as Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity (HVCI), uses an isolated virtual environment to run integrity checks of kernel mode software, enhancing protection against malware trying to exploit the OS kernel.";"Integer";"3";"@{Status=NotCompliant; Reason=3 is not equal to 0; Severity=Critical}"
"SecureBootState";"Secure boot is a security standard developed by members of the PC industry to help make sure that a device boots using only software that is trusted by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).";"Integer";"1";"@{Status=Compliant; Reason=1 is equal to 1; Severity=Critical}"
"SystemGuardStatus";"Using processor support for Dynamic Root of Trust of Measurement (DRTM) technology, System Guard puts firmware in a hardware-based sandbox helping to limit the impact of vulnerabilities in millions of lines of highly privileged firmware code.";"Integer";"2";"@{Status=NotCompliant; Reason=2 is not equal to 0; Severity=Critical}"
"TPMVersion";"Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology is designed to provide hardware-based, security-related functions.";"String";;"@{Status=NotCompliant; Reason=(null) does not match the pattern: 2\.0; Severity=Critical}"
"VirtualizationBasedSecurityStatus";"Virtualization-based security, or VBS, uses hardware virtualization features to create and isolate a secure region of memory from the normal operating system.
